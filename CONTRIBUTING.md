Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving detection. Keep contributions focused on:
- New detection checks and checks that are safe to run on user machines.
- Improvements to logging and reporting formats.
- Tests or examples demonstrating detection improvements.

Do not add code that fetches or executes suspicious remote payloads. If a pull request adds a new check that may have side effects, document it clearly and make the default behavior non-destructive.
